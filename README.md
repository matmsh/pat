# pat
pat is a sample/app that I have used in my blog post and conference talk introducing akka typed and ZIO Actors

You can find the slides to my talk here: <https://github.com/softinio/talks/blob/master/SBTB2020/acting-lessons-for-scala-engineers-with-akka-and-zio.pdf>

Will post a link to the recording of my talk here when its available. 

I am also posting Blogs related to this talk and more so visit my blog: <https://www.softinio.com>

# Notes

- Note that this apps has two mains. One for the `akka` sample and one for the `zio-actors` sample. To compile and run make sure the one you want to test is uncommented and the other main commented out. 
- Only the ADD command implemented so far will add GET and REMOVE and maybe even use a real datastore in the future to complete this example when I
    get a chance.
