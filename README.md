# pat
pat is a sample/app that I have used in my blog post and conference talk introducing akka typed and ZIO Actors

# Notes

- Note that this apps has two mains. One for the `akka` sample and one for the `zio-actors` sample. To compile and run make sure the one you want to test is uncommented and the other main commented out.
